#### Figure title : A cortical neural network for the vision of natural textures 
#### Authors : Hugo Ladret, Laurent Perrinet
 
### About the data
As this figure is part of a paper currently in preparation, full dataset cannot be publicly released. We do not use 'fake data' : the plot displays a representative sub-sample of the complete neuronal activity dataset. 

Nonetheless, we do also include two functions (*gen_tc()* & *gen_psth()*) to generate artificial data if needed, but they are unused in the submitted plot.

### Abstract

### Acknowledgements
I'd like to thank [Laurent Perrinet](https://laurentperrinet.github.io/authors/laurent-u-perrinet/) for his supervision of the research project and his valuable feedback on this figure, as well as Louis Eparvier for early feedback on the figure layout.
